# Coding_Quiz

In this project, I was able to create a functioning quiz utilizing what i learned with API's, javascript, css, and html. I was able to create a 10 question quiz which can be quickly edited to add more questions. I was able to add a leaderboard and added some semblance of a sorting system, but was not able to figure it out before the deadline. Besides that everything I was able to do fairly straight forward. Overall a large challenge for me and I'll be sure to try and fix the code for a future date.
